A platform that provides a database of cat care information and maintains a community of cat owners 

What: 
Catbook is a platform that maintains a community of cat owners who could share their experience on cat care or just show off their little kitties, and maintains a comprehensive database of information about cats. 
These information includes but is not limited to: 
-	What type of food or brand of food does specific breed of cat like? 
-	How to deal with cat’s depression? 
-	The personality and characteristics of cats of different breed
-	How to take care of cats of different ages? 
-	Useful toys or tools
-	Etc.  

Why: 
I am personally not a cat person. However, almost all of my friends either have one or more cats or plan to adopt one in the future. Many of them, when first adopted their cats, had no idea how to care for them. For example, what kind of food they should choose among all of the different kinds of cat food in the market; is dry food better or wet food better; how to determine whether their cats are having stress response; how to deal with cat’s stress response; how to help with cat’s depression; what kinda of disease each specific breed of cats tend to have; how to prevent them. This is simply a simplified list of the questions my friends asked when first adopted their cats. 
After seeing this demand, I started looking for whether there exists a platform that provides comprehensive information on cat care. Unfortunately, I only found articles from different websites rather than a single platform that contained comprehensive information. In addition, these articles tend to be extremely long and general rather than fun and helpful. 
Therefore, I believe there is a need for an interesting and helpful platform that provides comprehensive information on cat care and maintains a community of cat owners who can share their experience easily. 

For whom: 
This app is meant for people who plan to adopt cats in the future, who are new cat owners, who have had a lot of experience with cat care, and just everyone who loves cats and wants to know more about them. 

How: 
There are 2 main features: 
-	Users easily share their experience about their journey of cat care 
-	The platform provides verified information about cats, categorized by breeds and age 
Since this will be a web application, we will need to design a user interface (of course), create and maintain a database where we will keep all of the information on cats and all of the user information and posts, and research on cat care to provide an initial database of informations.
